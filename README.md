# FinancialSentiments

In the context of machine learning, the field of sentiment analysis in texts has gained much
interest in recent years thanks to the success and good performance of text classification
algorithms. The goal of the project is to apply this sentiment analysis technology to the field
of finance in order to tell whether a text is rather positive or negative. This information could
be used in the field of Forex to predict the rise or fall of a currency.

This report traces the different steps in creating machine learning and deep learning models
for predicting sentiment on sentences in a financial context. The models are trained with a
vocabulary specific to finance. An initial data set containing more than 2800 titles of financial
articles was provided to me to train models. Different steps such as sentence pre-processing,
representation of a sentence in numbers were performed. Several types of machine learning
and deep learning models have been developed to solve this problem.

Titles of financial articles labeled by experts were provided to validate my models.

The results obtained show that with the sentiment analysis techniques used and the models
developed, it is difficult to obtain satisfactory results on the validation data. The developed
models do not have better results than web-based sentiment analyzers.
